Quack is a very simple and minimalist client for DuckDuckGo Instant Answers. According to DuckDuckGo, an "Instant Answer" hopes to define peoples, places, things, words, and concepts, as well as provide some related topics. Quack is just a simple means of accessing that information in an easy to digest way. If you are not satisfied with the information provided, you can always click the "More Info" button, and be directed to the direct search results from DuckDuckGo in your mobile browser.

## Version 1.0

**Features**:
- Get results from DuckDuckGo Instant Answer API as a list of cards
- More Info button that links to actual search results from DuckDuckGo in your mobile browser

Note that these are not the full search results from DuckDuckGo, as stated in their API documentation. Also, support for [!bang](https://api.duckduckgo.com/bang) syntax is hopefully coming soon.
